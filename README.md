# Message encryption by date

  
Simple program that encrypts and decrypts messages using date.


# Execution

  
To **encrypt** the message just run the encrypt.py file using python 3, the message to be encrypted and any date must be passed as an argument (The same date will be used to decrypt the past message). Example:
> $ python3 encrypt.py msgOriginal.txt 30/07/2019
  
To decrypt the message a similar process must be performed, but the decrypt.py file must be executed this time, the encrypted message generated with the execution of encrypt.py and the same date used for encryption must be passed as an argument. Example:
> $ python3 dencrypt.py msgEncrypted.sec 30/07/2019
